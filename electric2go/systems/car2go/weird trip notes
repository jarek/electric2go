Initial ideas
=============

Some categories of "weird" trips that might be of concern in analysis/stats.py:
- Trips with really short distance but long duration and significant fuel use
  - These are likely to be round trips, treat them as normal except maybe collect separately for analysis
- Trips with really short distance and zero fuel use
  - These are likely to be lapsed reservations, especially if duration is exactly 30 minutes
    (though note that you can cancel a booking so not necessarily 30 minutes)
    (added complication of fuel level wobble possibility)
- Trips with really short distance and really short duration
  - These are GPS wobble

The procedure was then to take a ~big dataset (ended up being a week of Vancouver data),
take short-distance trips from that dataset, get stats on on duration and fuel use,
see if any of the above categories are in fact present, if so isolate and report on them.


Distances
=========

In a 7-day vancouver sample, going by distance only, as ratio of all trips:

- under 0.01 km : 0.00630854060822
- under 0.02 km : 0.00821073415039
- under 0.05 km : 0.0106667308757
- under 0.1 km : 0.0151453131396

100 m is definitely a valid trip (though a suspected round trip).
Under 50 m, I examined further.
Shortest "trip" in the dataset is 0.00111194926601 km, that is 1.1 m.


Fuel use
========

For all trips (n=41809), fuel use most common values are : [(0, 26105), (3, 11356), (6, 1621), (4, 762)]
1 and 2 aren't in top ten, suggesting that the measurement isn't accurate enough to give 1% resolution?
- fuel use over 1 ratio : 0.3497811476
- fuel use over 5 ratio : 0.0599392475304
- fuel use over 10 ratio : 0.00674495921931
- fuel use under 1 ratio : 0.6502188524
- fuel use under 5 ratio : 0.94006075247

So low fuel use is not a reliable indicator generally. Must be combined with other factors.


Durations
=========

In the dataset of 41809:
- Trips of 1 minute are 275 (0.67%). Median distance 6.2 m. 64% are under 10 m. 24% are over 20 m, 20% over 50 m. Fuel use is 90% 0.
- Trips of 2 minutes are 58 (0.14%). Median distance 1.21 km (!). 27.5% are under 20 m, and 25th percentile is 15.6 m,
    but it goes really high after that: 75th percentile is 3.19 km, and max is 7.77 km. Fuel use is 84% 0, there are 7 3%s, one 4%, and -79%.
    Obviously 1.2 km in 2 minutes is pretty big (36 km/h just driving and without allowing time to start/finish trip),
    so it's likely that are mostly errors and weird things. But the prevalence (0.14%) is very low so perhaps it can just be ignored.
    We'll just do a best-effort exclusion of that bottom 25% of trips that can be definitely said to not be "real" trips.
- Trips over 2 minutes but under 6 minutes are 616 (1.5%). Mean distance is 806 m.
    90% of trips are over 50 m, only 7.5% under 20 m. 80% of fuel use is 0, next most common is 3 at 15%.

Lapsed reservations (duration ~30 min) weren't a significant ratio of the short-distance trips as far as I can tell, so not tracking those further for now.

Thoughts for the future: maybe subtract 2-3 minutes from duration of trip to account for trip start and end procedures
and calculate speed outside those times? If it's something obviously high (>80 km/h perhaps?) there is a problem.


Decision
========

Decided to exclude:

- Distance under 10 m and duration under 4 minutes and fuel use > -2:
    - Too short to be a real trip, too quick to be a round trip,
      fuel use criterion allows accidental wobbles while excluding possible refuels
- Distance under 50 m and duration of 1 minute and fuel use > -2:
    - Too quick to be a real trip, so this is GPS wobble.

These criteria find 245 trips in the set of 41809, or 0.585998%.

For comparison, if the criterion was duration <= 5 minutes and distance < 50 m,
it would match 294 trips, or 0.7031979%.
But at the outer limit, 5 minutes and 50 m is a possible quick round trip, so I decided to be a bit more stringent.

Because of the low prevalence this is really best-effort to try to find some of the obvious errors,
and it's not a huge problem if we don't find everything.
