https://api.go-drive.com/api/areas to get operation areas (not included for_areas response)
https://api.go-drive.com/api/car_types to get car types (not included in for_areas response)
https://api.go-drive.com/api/cars/for_areas to get free-floating cars
https://api.go-drive.com/api/hubs.json to get cars in hubs

hub api endpoint scheme is interesting
- it doesn't give all the available cars, just their amount
- if there's 2+ available cars, it only has information for one of them
  (one longest there? not sure)
- if there are none, it adds a dummy car instead

In [1]: import requests

In [2]: r = requests.get('https://api.go-drive.com/api/hubs.json')

In [3]: j = r.json()

In [4]: sum(h['cars']['petrol']['availability'] for h in j)
Out[4]: 14

In [5]: sum(h['cars']['electric']['availability'] for h in j)
Out[5]: 18

In [7]: [h['cars']['electric']['availability'] for h in j if h['cars']['electric']['availability'] > 1]
Out[7]: [2, 2, 2]

In [8]: [h['cars']['petrol']['availability'] for h in j if h['cars']['petrol']['availability'] > 1]
Out[8]: []
