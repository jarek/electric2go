Find electric car2go vehicles and play with data a little bit

Finding electric cars
---------------------

Simple web page listing currently available electric car2go vehicles in 
a car2go-serviced city.

Preview at http://bin.piorkowski.ca/electric2go/

The page shows quick links to electric car2go listings for cities where there's
a few electric cars. (This is specified with 'electric': 'some' in CITIES
dictionary in cars.py.)

This will technically work for any car2go city (manually specify the ?city= URL
param), though attempting to load a city with no electric cars like Toronto 
will just inform you there are 0 available, and attempting to load 
an all-electric city like San Diego or Amsterdam is an excellent way to 
kill your Google Maps free map quota with 200+ mapping requests.

As the car2go API v2.1 (current as of time of writing) does not support 
searching by engine type, the application downloads a list of all cars
available in the city and filters it before displaying.

This download is normally a couple tens of kilobytes and takes a second or two.
To speed this up, download.py can be used to download the files regularly 
and save them locally for use as a cache. The scripts will automatically 
look for a file named data/current\_$cityname and compare its modification 
timestamp to see if it is recent enough (default allowed age is 60 seconds). 
If it is, the file will be used instead of redownloading the information. 
download.py is most useful when invoked automatically by cron or similar tool. 
A sample crontab entry is included in `crontab` file.

Files involved:

- cars.py: contains data retrieval and parsing logic
- index.py: contains display logic and HTML pasta
- sort.js: sorts car list by distance from user's reported geolocation
- style.css

Optionally:

- download.py: caches data for faster operation
- crontab: sample crontab entry for invoking download.py

Playing with data
-----------------

process.py can be used to generate location maps of car2go vehicles at a given 
time. These maps can be animated into a video that shows car movement 
over time.

process.py -h describes the arguments it supports.

Data is collected with download.py. Cities indicated as 'of\_interest': 'some' 
in CITIES dictionary in cars.py will have their information saved to 
an appropriately-named file every cars.DATA\_COLLECTION\_INTERVAL\_MINUTES.

Sample output: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nveWwk3VSg

There is also some basic statistics (-s) and vehicle tracing (-trace).
Keep in mind that the statistics are only as good as the data coming in.
For instance, reserved cars disappear off the available vehicles list, 
so any time reserved will be counted as trip time.

Files involved:

- cars.py: data retrieval logic and constants
- download.py: downloads and saves information for selected cities
- crontab: sample crontab entry for invoking download.py
- process.py: creates maps and visualizations based on the data
- backgrounds/\* - city maps from openstreetmap used as video backgrounds
