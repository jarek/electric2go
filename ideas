process.make_graph refactor:
	refactor things a bit first to enable things like _accessibility_graph
	and other similar future functions. have one function to create 
	plot/axes for a city (and reuse them to save time on that timer task),
	another to plot points, then savefig() in a separate spot where it can
	be bypassed by things like _accessibility_graph that want to add more 
	information still

process.make_accessibility_graph:
	extend make_graph to shade out areas more than 5 minutes walk
	from nearest car2go (~330 m).
	should be able to reuse much of make_graph
	don't draw move lines
	
	have a numpy matrix the size of MAP_X * MAP_Y, initialize as zeros
	for each car, calculate pixels within 330 m around it
	(this is an approximation since you can't walk in straight lines 
	but close enough without major street info data crunching)
	for each of these pixels, increment its matrix value

	then initially just draw gray pixels for each of the array
	slots that aren't zeros.
	in version 2.0, maybe do fancy grayscale 
	or alpha transparency to account for accessibility to multiple cars
	(in case someone grabs one or something)

process.make_cleanness_graph:
	extend make_graph, using different colour indicators for 
	the different reported cleanness levels to answer the important
	question: do kits people mark cars as dirty more frequently
	than east van people?!

trace.find_car:
	given a data file and a license plate or VIN, trace car's movements
	during the day/in provided set of files

trace.cleanness:
	somehow visualize cars that went from indicated 'unacceptable'
	cleanness rating back to 'good'. see how often and where that happens!

more visualization ideas:
	all of a day's / period's move lines rendered into one image, with
	no location points or underlying map. see if you can identify cities
	or gain any particularly deep insight

	similarly, all location points during a day/week with no underlying
	map, with or without move lines. see how much data is needed until 
	you can visually identify the city, if at all

	could be almost art~~~
